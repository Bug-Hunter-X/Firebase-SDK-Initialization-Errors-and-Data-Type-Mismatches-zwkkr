The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the project configuration is incorrect or if there are issues with the authentication process.  For example, if the `google-services.json` file is missing or incorrectly configured, initialization might fail.  Another common issue is when using Firebase Realtime Database, incorrect data types passed to `setValue()` can cause silent failures or unexpected behavior.
